This project aims to detect credit card details within messages using machine learning techniques. The goal is to preprocess text data, convert it into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models, train classifiers, and fine-tune the models to achieve high accuracy in detecting sensitive information. Additionally, the project integrates model outputs into a MongoDB database for easy access and further analysis.
